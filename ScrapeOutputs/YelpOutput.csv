"Charlestown, MA",2,"If rated on the food alone, I'd easily give Select 4 stars: We ordered a round of oysters that were as fresh as we've had at other spots, along with the tuna crudo, which was delicious.  However:1. We were sitting at the bar with some other guests, and my husband saw a bartender drop two oysters from a bin onto a dirty rubber bar mat on the floor and then throw them back into a pile with other oysters they were preparing to serve. Yeah, I get oysters are in a shell, but it's a shell you need to touch to serve your food. I'm no germaphobe, but I'd hold this place (with it's price point/20% gratuity) to higher standards. Accordingly, I'd expect a place like this to be very focused on presentation and how they manage their food. 2. That 20% gratuity; it irked us. We eat out A LOT, and we're always prepared to pay a premium for great service, but automatically including it on the bill is extremely presumptuous and can create some awkwardness for a diner forced to confront a server about bad service or to let them know they aren't willing to pay 20%. We asked the bartender what was behind the 20% added, and she gave us a coached response about providing workers a living wage; that some restaurants on the west coast and Miami already do this; and customer ease so they don't have to do the math. She also noted that this ""avant-garde approach"" should be adopted by more restaurants. Look, I'm all for companies providing folks a living wage, but as another Yelper mentioned, this place charges enough that they should be able to provide their staff just that. If Select's aim is to provide ""customer ease,"" they should consider the strange position they put them in having to ask the staff about the gratuity and/or confronting them if they want it removed."
"The Rocks, Australia",5,"Definitely not your typical New England oyster bar. Very interesting versions of very fresh fish, shellfish and such. This small casual place is worth seeking out when in Bean Town. You can mix it up with the variety of starters or fresh oysters. Their mains are fresh, creative and tasty. Very accommodating staff in a casual setting. I'll be back as I want to taste everything in the menu - eventually! This is a 5 Star seafood place!"
"Centreville, VA",5,"Wonderful!!!!!  Start to finish fantastic.  Everything from the person on the other end of the phone making our reservations to the wonderful person collecting our check AND of course everything in between (even the food ).  Our server was a true pro,  knowledge of wine, beer and food was a ten.  Atmosphere was as ""hip"" as anyplace I've been; comfortable, cute, intimate and happenin'!!!  I am writing this as we are finishing up our experience here, computers need with me wife and two children 11 and 9.  Obviously if your reading this review STOP, make a reservation or just walk in.  You will not be disappointed.  TERRIFIC!!!!"
"North Adams, MA",1,Incredibly rude and uptight environment/staff. Not a place I would recommend trying to go for a relaxing night.
"Arlington, MA",5,"We had a lovely evening at Select. Excellent service coupled w delicious interesting seafood. Had oysters, anchovies, halibut and swordfish.  All local and delish. Amazing wine list. Friendly staff and customers give this place a very local feel. For out-of-towners- nice alternative to the large seafood places that attract conventioneers. Very comfortable for someone eating alone.  Not inexpensive at all but the quality of seafood is there to support the prices. Fresh local seafood is not cheap."
"ROXBURY CROSSING, MA",4,Excellent seafood. Tucked away place in back bay near newbury. Very delicious bouillabaisse and lobster sandwich. We sat at the bar and the server was very friendly and attentive. Not too crowded when we went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Will definitely go back!
"Baltimore, MD",2,"Nice decor, nice clean atmosphere, great cocktails, good appetizers, very limited menu. Overpriced. The female bartender was snippy and not too fast. I realized she didn't have to be friendly because they automatically add 20% gratuity. What a turn-off."
"Boston, MA",5,"Simply fresh and oh so delish...Oysters on the half shell, great selection and we left it up to our waiter to decide on the trioOctopus Salad marvelous grilled n tender peeking out from the fresh greensScallop Cerviche. Sweet n tenderLobster, shelled, just the right touch of seasoningTuna tartare divineA bottle of Rose, nice selection reasonably priced"
"Paris, France",5,"This (mostly countertop) oyster bar offers some of New England's best bivalves and creative seasonal crudos to a clued up Bostonian dining crowd accompanied by a great wine list and craft beers. Michael, the Cuban patron, used to be head chef at Neptune, probably the city's best known oyster bar. As its small plates mostly, prices can escalate quickly but happy to say it's worth it. Great concept."
"South Brookline, MA",3,"Pros:  inventive, well-mixed cocktails, fresh, well-prepared fish/seafood.Cons: 1) the ratio of prices to portion size and caliber of the establishment is a little absurd; 2) music is loud and quite overpowering 3) automatic 20 percent gratuity?!  If you want to make sure your waitstaff are taken care of, by all means, do so by raising their wages,but do not pass that burden on to the customer, especially at your price point.  If service is sub-par I may choose to tip 15 percent, and I find the demand for 20 percent to be somewhat obnoxious."
"Reading, PA",2,"The place is very nice and inviting but as soon as we entered, even though the place was mostly empty (late afternoon) we were greeted by a very abrupt and unpleasant waiter that pretty much let us know, since we don't have a reservation we must be guilty of something and are getting what she's gonna give us - don't ask questions - I let you in didn't I ?The place was beautiful we were excited about the menu, oysters, great wine, but two tag-team waiters with a superiority attitude really ruined the experience for us ...not worth the money $$$$$ for the attention we received... Unless you sit by the bar, people seam to be having a better time with the bartender... NOT an enjoyable experience."
"Honolulu, HI",2,"Overrated!!! No complaints about the food quality,  the execution is minimal, but their ""curated"" seafood is absolutely overpriced given the availability of great seafood all over Boston.  The 20% automatic tip makes it so the servers don't really try.  The gals weren't impolite, but they were not particularly warm or attentive.  Why go here, when so many good options abound?"
"South End, Boston, MA",4,"the only place i'd go ballerz (in Boston) for a plateau de fruits de mer aka the Select. top tip: seafood ain't cheap and if it is, could be dodgy (just sayin)."
"Atlanta, GA",5,"Loved everything: cocktails, mussels, salmon crudo, and oysters. In short, a meal here is a liquor/protein bomb. The salmon crudo was probably the best thing I can remember eating, ever. It was so tender, sweet, and had lime and red chili to complement.My group had an early reservation (5pm), and it was mostly just us there until about 6:30. So go early if you've struck out getting a table at prime time previously."
"Providence, RI",4,"The same chef that used to work at Neptune has some ownership here (Neptune = 5 star seafood to me).Back to Select Oyster Bar, it's ""Select"" oyster and has a curated selection of oysters (on the day I went 6 different kinds) plus other kinds of raw bar items available. It's a casual neighborhood restaurant with a low key vibe and low key pleasant service that isn't as formal as some old school steak and seafood type restaurants. It's very good and the pricing is on the pricier side, but is appropriate given the real estate off Newbury Street in sight of the Prudential building. The dishes we had were great, the raw bar being the highlight and well worth the price. I'll be back for raw bar especially given the fact that I can book an Opentable reservation here in advance."
"Portage, IN",4,"Went by Select on a Sunday around 5pm for some oysters and a beer. Much to our surprise there was no wait, in fact the place was a ghost town save a handful of people at the bar. The oyster selection is good, the presentation is great - very much on par with Neptune. Price per oyster is slightly more expensive than other comparable restaurants, and a description of the oysters would be helpful, especially when trying to branch out and try something different. The shrimp cocktail was better than most and worth a shot.Beer selection is just ok-few local beers available. Service was good, as should be the expectation when there are five people dining. As noted in other reviews there is a 20% gratuity automatically included. As a decent tipper, I don't find this to be an issue, and the service was good enough to justify it on this particular visit."
"Boston, MA",4,"Easily the best Seafood option in Boston that takes reservations (Row 34 is a close 2nd for lunch and Island Creek for Dinner). Neptune, where Select's chef (Serpa) hails from is still the best-non reservation option and Overall Seafood restaurant in Boston. I've been here now a handful of times and will continue to come back. Here's the rundown: - Usually worth checking out the special board - Madai Crudo was excellent - Oysters are shucked to Neptune standards - Great range of crudos which is now a primary gauge of how I judge any seafood restaurants - Tuna Tartare - excellent - Bluefish - excellent - Arctic Char - solid - Avocado Toast - do it - Burrata - great app - Octopus - good, but not as tender as I expected. High bar for Octopus in Boston at this point. Pass -  - Scallop Crudo was a miss. Pass - Sea Bream is the best option on the Entree menu right now. Put this on your shortlistCame in around early May and had their Lobster Lunch Sandwich special. Probably the best dish I've ever had at Select."
"New York, NY",4,"After reading some good things about this place, I decided to head there with my parents and a friend when they were in town. We were sure to make a reservation as this place is pretty small and hard to get into otherwise.To start off the meal, we decided to split an order of the tuna tartare. This tuna was very fresh and flavorful, but I thought it was odd that they didn't serve it with any sort of vehicle to eat it with. Apparently, you are just supposed to eat in by itself, but I elected to put it atop some bread instead.For my main meal, I split an order of the char and the halibut. Both pieces of fish were good, but I would have to say that I liked the halibut a bit better as it really was able to soak up flavor from the other ingredients in the dish. In addition, I had a couple bites of the swordfish from my father and really enjoyed that as well.Overall, though the seafood here is very tasty, I feel like the prices are a bit overdone--especially since you can get pretty high quality seafood around the city for less $. In addition, I had one of their mixed drinks and it was basically all ice--so I wasn't too keen on that. Add to that the fact that you have to put a deposit down for a reservation, and I probably won't be making it back anytime soon, as there are much more laid back/cheaper dinner spots throughout Boston."
"Cambridge, MA",1,"There are oyster joints in Boston that'll treat you like they're interested in you rather than your wallet. This place is like being mugged at gun point in a dark alley, but one that has an oyster shucker. Select doesn't have an oyster for less than $3. They don't have an appetizer for less than $20. They don't have a HALF bottle of wine for less than $40. And to add insult to injury, they have a mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of any size whatsoever! Go to Neptune. Go to B&G. Go to Island Creek. Don't ever go here."
"The Heights, Houston, TX",3,"The food was amazing, especially the Hamachi Crudo, but the waitstaff and host were not friendly. We arrived 10 minutes late to our 5:30 pm reservation and even though there were plenty of tables open (and were still open when we left), the host sat us at the bar with a snide remark about our tardiness. I understand losing your table when you're late to a packed restaurant but this seemed a bit unnecessary as did his comment."
"Boston, MA",2,"We were excited to visit this place for the first time. Made a noon reservation for a Saturday. Upon arrival, the hostess was unbelievably rude. The venue was empty and my friend, who had arrived earlier than me, was unable to sit because of ""the owners rules."" I repeat, the venue was empty. Not a soul. She was asked to stand by the window until I arrived. Once we were seated, the food was fantastic. I suggest the avocado toast. However, the waitress was completely inattentive and it was hard to get our food order in. Then when we asked for the check, we watched as the waitress poured seven drinks and served 2 sets of oysters before making it to the computer. On top of it all, they charged 20% for tip automatically when they didn't deserve one cent. This place is pretentious and the service is terrible. I dine out every night and I will never be back."
"Boston, MA",3,"This place is a good seafood restaurant but if you are looking for an Oyster place the name is misleading as although they do offer oysters, their selection is very limited (explains rating of 3 stars only). The sitting is very limited so make sure you book a table although walk in are welcome expect a long waiting time. Definitely sit at the bar if you are in a tête à tête.They also automatically add a 20% gratuity so don't be surprised when you get the check !"
"Boston, MA",1,This place is horrifyingly overpriced. There are so many other places in the city to get seafood and the automatic 21% gratuity on our bill of just oysters and drinks was absurd. Also $18 glasses of wine when I could buy the same bottle for $24. There are just other places where you can get the better value for the same quality. Maybe there rent is rough but I can't think of anything that justifies this. The staff was helpful despite knocking my friends chair multiple times in the tight quarters. Glad we tried it as an appetizer stop and didn't commit to dinner.
"Danvers, MA",4,"Friendly wait staff, bartender was very impersonal. There were 4 people at the bar and it took her fifteen minutes to come over to us and take our order. Disappointed at that, she also made a face when I gave her my ID. Sorry, definitely 21 and dining with my mother. The other lady who gave us the oysters with short blonde hair was hilarious and super friendly.On a better note: Oysters are out of this world. The atmosphere is modern and just what I wanted at this type of a restaurant. However, the lunch menu had no lunch sized options. I wanted a sandwich or something, but everything was entrée sized. Also the specials chalkboard was empty and they should move some of the Rosé real estate over to make room for better beer.The actual food was very good. We ordered the Spanish Octopus and Mussels. The only minor issue was it only came with one little slice of bread. When you have a slurpable broth, you gotta give some bread to give yourself some credit."
