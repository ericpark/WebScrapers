"Lausanne, Switzerland",5,You better have to book your table in advance to make sure you can enjoy amazing and delicious large choice of oysters ! All the menu is great and service just perfect. Very small very local and very noisy but super great !
"Brooklyn, New York",5,"We had such a great time here for lunch. Service was great, very attentive. The food we had was so delicious and fresh. Would eat here all the time if I could."
Framingham,2,"My husband and I love trying new restaurants with great wine lists. So,we had dinner at Select Oyster last Friday night. We started off with various local oysters. All good and fresh. For an appetizer I had the peekytoe crab salad- way, WAY too salty. For dinner I had the halibut. It was ""just fine"" but the sides did not...More  "
"Austin, Texas",4,"The oysters were fantastic- we got a variety and tasted them all- very fresh. The Cerviche was also very fresh and enjoyed it very much. The service was alright, better than what I read most had experienced there for sure. She was attentive just not very personable. The Halibut in my opinion was marginal and the tomatoes that were served...More  "
"New York City, New York",5,"What a treat! Yelp directed us to the Back Bay rests since first pick had 1.5 hour wait. Select had a great vibe, we sat at bar and felt like we were only ones in place. Woman behind bar quickly took deonk order and set aside the last Black Sea bass crudo. That was excellent and we topped off with...More  "
"New York City, New York",3,"We went to Select to eat fresh oysters and good sea food. Everything we ordered (three types of oysters, a tuna tartar and a lobster sandwich) was absolutely delicious. The bill, however, was over USD 100, and all we had to drink was soda. So be prepared to leave a lot of money on the table, or look for other...More  "
Boston,5,"We have been wanting to try Select Oyster Bar since they have opened and finally did.We were greeted promptly and warmly by the staff. Our male waiter was attentive, made great recommendations, and served our courses at a nice pace.The mussel appetizer was prepared in a way we have not had. Inventive and delicious. The shrimp cocktail while...More  "
illinois,5,"Great place, great people and the food is the best in Boston ! Nothing else to say. Wines are really good follow their lead and try and share everything they have. It's a fun place to meet up."
Caracas,4,"The select platter was gorgeous: oysters, the biggest shrimp ever, lobster salad to die for, scallop ceviche and crab salad. Everything was good. Salmon crudo top of the line. Excellent wines too. The service could be a little more helpful and gracious, but otherwise, very recommended."
"Washington, DC",2,"How ironic that a restaurant callled SELECT Oyster should serve such mediocre oysters, and a very limited selection at that. As far as our main course of bouillabaise, the broth had very little flavor and the seafood was fair. Don't understand the good reviews. The place was overpriced. We would not go back!"
"Rome, Italy",4,"A friend of ours took us here for a special seafood dining experience. We were seated at the bar which was nice because the barkeeper looked after us very well and was constantly available. The oysters were fresh and delicious and the avocado toast was very tasty. I had the bouillabaisse which I almost didn't manage to finish, it was...More  "
"Boston, Massachusetts",3,"Starting by saying except for one appetizer, the food was fantastic. Inventive, interesting, really wonderful flavor combinations, excellent fresh quality. But, the service and attitude - makes it not worth going back. Plus, when it is hot outside, ""outdoor"" dining is just unbearable - they drop plastic ""windows"" in the back area and had overhead fans and a portable AC....More  "
"Allentown, Pennsylvania",2,Started off a little rocky when they told us that a table for five was opening up immediately and they could seat us right away....then they shuffled us to the window area at bar and said we should order drinks while waiting. It was getting late and we intentionally stopped here instead of other nearby places on Newbury street based...More  
Michigan,3,"Well, the main course was great and the oysters were as well. As expected. This place has a lot of shortcomings.1. Reservations are recommended, if for any reason you miss, you get charged a fee2. Mandatory Tipping ! Your bill will have 20% added on, no matter how many in group and how good or bad the service....More  "
"Winnipeg, Canada",5,Came highly recommended by our hotel concierge and did not disappoint . Great atmosphere with top notch service made the scrumptious food all blend into a fantastic night out in Newbury
"Framingham, Massachusetts",4,Tried their lobster sandwich which came with a nice green garden salad. You can also get a nice lobster salad. Both around $ 32.00 to $36.00 and loaded with lobster. Sat at the bar and the bartender was great.
Las Vegas,5,"Truly an oyster bar but upscale. We sat at the bar which was elbow to elbow almost, but on a good way. Nice vibe. Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful. She told us the house special right away because there was only one available. So we ordered it and glad we did 'lobster salad' but the most tasty and...More  "
"Sao Paulo, SP",5,"Small and modern restaurant/bar, nice decoration, cosy environment, with very good food (we had and recommend the tuna tartar and the avocado toasts).Service is attentious and efficient. It certainly deserves a visit for lunch or dinner or even (perhaps mainly) for drinks and tapas.Price per person $100 (service and wine, no dessert)."
"Carlisle, Massachusetts",4,"This is definitely a restaurant worth visiting if you like seafood. When we were there for lunch it wasn't very busy but dinner is probably a different story. My husband tried several kinds of oysters (all great) and I had the scallop ceviche (absolutely first rate). Then we each had the mussels with romesco sauce, very good. My only surprise...More  "
"Sao Paulo, SP",5,We had lunch at the oyster bar. Great food... almost as good as Neptune Oyster. The bartender was really good.
London,5,"Recommended to us by friends and located in one of the streets joining Boylston and Newbury streets, the restaurant is specialising in oysters and seafood but everything in an innovative way cooked and presented, so if you are looking for the clam chowder and similar dishes, you will not find them.The crab salad and the octopus salad are superb....More  "
"Cambridge, Massachusetts",5,"My girlfriend and I recently had dinner at Select Oyster - the food and service were both incredible. We especially liked the salmon crudo, raw oyster selection, octopus salad, and swordfish entree. Our server was incredibly friendly and helpful. Cocktails were delicious. Venue can be a bit loud (especially the back porch), and the meal was quite pricey. Though, overall,...More  "
"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",5,"Stopped here in a Friday night to try fresh seafood dishes that were not traditional chowder/fried clams. Everything was superb, from a scallop ceviche that was bright with a hint of citrus, a varied oyster selection that was of absolute top quality, and an arctic char main dish with a pistachio oil that was one of a kind. I am...More  "
Tarzana,1,"Select Oyster bar pretends to be an upscale establishment.However, they everything but upscale.They require a credit card number in order to secure e reservation which I provided.However, when we arrived I was told the wait is 25-30 minutes.The place wasn't air-conditioned and very stuffy, very crowded, very primitive furniture, no decor and extremely noisy.Oysters aren't...More  "
"San Francisco, California",5,This is a very nice casual place with excellent service and food. I had crudo and a lobster salad. Both were delicious. Lobster salad had extremely fresh farm-to-table ingredients and generous amount of lobster. Delicious. The only strange thing they do not serve any coffee or deserts.. Chefs policy.. but that would not stop me from coming back.
"Los Angeles, California",5,Fantastic dinner at the bar served by Gina. Oysters were as good as expected but it is the other dishes that blew us away. Best octopus dish ever. And that's a lot of octopus dish to beat! Chorizo clams outstanding.
"San Francisco, California",5,"Though expensive, everything we ordered from raw oysters & clams to the main courses were exceptionally fresh and flavorful, as well as creative. I had the best Spanish octopus! Though not a place where you can easily have a conversation, I highly recommend this to get probably the best fresh seafood in Boston."
"Newton, Massachusetts",1,"We had booked on open table and had mentioned in the comment section that it was my birthday. We were given seats at the bar. My husband said it was a birthday, we did not feel like being crushed or bumped at the bar. This is a very small restaurant. The wait staff have a narrow thouroughfare to get to...More  "
"London, United Kingdom",5,"Sat at the bar in this busy, attractive oyster and seafood restaurant. The bartender was especially knowledgeable and attentive, the menu was great, and the service and food were excellent."
Maine,3,"We had read and heard how wonderful this neighborhood ""place"" was, so of course with reservation is hand we went. 2 of us at a table for almost one person, BUT that was better than a communal high top or the bar, those are the choices, Not great! we ordered wine which was overpriced for the amount served, but ok....More  "
"New York City, New York",5,I've been here three times in the last six months. Best seafood in Boston. Everything is fresh and creatively prepared. Also reasonably priced. The black bass crudo is outstanding. The scallop ceviche refreshing. The octopus is delicious and comes with nice snap peas and tomatillo. The mussels and clams are both very good and bountiful. The prawns are one of...More  
New York,5,As Boston's 'Best Restaurant of 2015' the Select doesn't need another glowing review. The seafood was fresh and delicious and nothing on the menu or the excellent 'by the glass' wine list is going to disappoint. A few notes: Select is very small and even a reservation may only garner you a seat at the bar. The restaurant offers no...More  
"Boston, Massachusetts",5,"Had another fantastic dining experience at Select this past weekend. We sat at the bar at around 6 on Saturday of Patriots' Day Weekend. (Yes, that's Boston Marathon weekend, and the restaurant is about half a block from the marathon course.) Boylston Street and the surrounding areas were bustling, and although there were some empty seats when we arrived, they...More  "
"Boston, Massachusetts",3,"Let's give credit where credit is due: The food was absolutely delicious. We had the octopus, clams, mussels, and oysters. The prices are definitely too high for this restaurant though. The average plate is $30, with the fish being $29 and the steak as high as 50-something. It's a small restaurant in the back bay with no valet parking and...More  "
